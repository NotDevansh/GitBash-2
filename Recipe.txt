How to make Egg Noodles
veggies
Step 1 Boil the noodles
To make this easy recipe, begin with par-boiling the noodles. Once done, drain the excess water and keep it aside. In the meantime, heat a pan over a medium flame. Once the oil is sufficiently hot, add the ginger-garlic paste and fry for some time. If you like to make it more delicious, add some finely chopped green chillies. You can also use chillies soaked in vinegar.

Step 2 Toss the veggies and cook the eggs
Then add the onions, beans and green chillies in the same pan and saute for a minute or two. Add the carrots, cabbage, salt, pepper powder, soy sauce and Ajinomoto. Stir-fry the ingredients for some time. Once done, add the boiled noodles and break the eggs into the pan. Mix well and cook for a few minutes. If you like smoky flavours, stir the veggies mix on a high flame.

Tips
To make the dish more amazing, add some finely chopped spring onions. This will add a nice flavour and colour.
While boiling the noodles, add a teaspoon refined oil and salt. This will prevent the noodles from sticking.
If you like the slightly burnt flavour, you can toss the noodles over high flame.
